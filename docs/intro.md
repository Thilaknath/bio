# About Me

 
Originally from Chennai, India, I completed my Bachelor's in Electronics and Communication, where I developed a deep interest in robotics and technology. During my undergraduate years, I actively engaged with the Robotics Interest Group, participating in prestigious Tech Fests at institutions such as IIT Kanpur, Anna University, and NIT Trichy. I was fortunate enough to secure top positions in several of these competitions, honing my technical and problem-solving skills.

Motivated to deepen my understanding of technology’s evolving landscape, I pursued a Master’s degree in Information System Security in Montreal, Canada. This journey allowed me to merge my passion for security with the latest advancements in technology, preparing me for the dynamic challenges in the field of cybersecurity and beyond.
