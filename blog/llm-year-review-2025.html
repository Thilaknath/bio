            <p>
                2025 was the year AI coding assistants stopped being novelties and became necessities. As someone who works at the intersection of compliance engineering and DevOps, I've watched this transformation with equal parts excitement and concern. Andrej Karpathy's recent <a href="https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/year-in-review-2025/">2025 year in review</a> captures the technical inflection points brilliantly, and I want to explore what these changes mean for those of us building and securing software at scale.
            </p>

            <h3>The Vibe Coding Threshold</h3>
            <p>
                Karpathy describes 2025 as the year "vibe coding" crossed a critical capability threshold. What does this mean practically? Code became disposable. I've found myself spinning up entire throwaway applications just to debug a single edge case, something that would have been unthinkable two years ago. The economics have fundamentally shifted—the bottleneck is no longer writing code, it's knowing what to build.
            </p>
            <p>
                This democratization matters more for regular engineers than it does for senior developers. A compliance analyst who understands regulatory requirements can now prototype their own automation tools without waiting for the engineering backlog. That's powerful, but it also creates new governance challenges.
            </p>

            <h3>Three Paradigm Shifts That Matter</h3>

            <h4>1. Cursor and the Application Layer</h4>
            <p>
                <a href="https://cursor.sh/">Cursor</a> revealed something important: LLMs need orchestration layers for professional work. It's not just autocomplete—it's context management, multi-step workflows, and domain-specific guardrails. Karpathy argues that labs will produce generalist models while applications will create specialized professional teams.
            </p>
            <p>
                From a compliance perspective, this is where controls need to live. You can't audit a raw LLM, but you can audit an application layer that logs queries, enforces approval workflows, and maintains separation of concerns.
            </p>

            <h4>2. Claude Code and Local Agents</h4>
            <p>
                The shift from cloud-based chatbots to local agents running on your machine changes the security model entirely. <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude/code">Claude Code</a> has access to your filesystem, your git history, your environment variables. That's incredibly powerful for productivity—it understands your actual codebase, not a sanitized description of it.
            </p>
            <p>
                But it also means we need to rethink data classification policies. What happens when an AI agent with read access to your laptop processes proprietary source code? How do we maintain audit trails? These aren't hypothetical questions—they're active discussions in compliance forums right now.
            </p>

            <h4>3. RLVR and the Reasoning Leap</h4>
            <p>
                Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) was 2025's technical breakthrough. Unlike previous training stages, RLVR lets models develop reasoning strategies in verifiable domains like math and code. This isn't just better autocomplete—models can now work through multi-step problems, catch their own mistakes, and explore solution spaces.
            </p>
            <p>
                Karpathy notes that "most of the capability progress of 2025 was defined by the LLM labs chewing through the overhang of this new stage." For developers, this means AI assistants that can actually debug complex issues, not just suggest syntax fixes.
            </p>

            <h3>Google's Gemini Push</h3>
            <p>
                Google made several key announcements in 2025. The one I enjoyed the most being Nano which inherently caused a dip in Adobe stocks overnight. I also enjoyed Antigravy, one of the many coding agents which they are offering. As with any Google products, we just have to wait and see which one of these will survive and emerge to be the sole winner in this space.
            </p>

            <h3>The Compliance Angle Nobody's Talking About</h3>
            <p>
                Here's what keeps me up at night: we're rapidly deploying AI coding assistants without updating our security controls. Consider:
            </p>

            <p><strong>Code provenance:</strong> When an AI generates a function, who owns the copyright? What if it regurgitates GPL code into your proprietary codebase? We need automated license scanning for AI-generated code, but the tooling doesn't exist yet.</p>

            <p><strong>Credential exposure:</strong> Developers are pasting error logs into LLM chats without redacting API keys, database strings, or internal URLs. Security teams need to implement DLP policies that understand this new attack surface.</p>

            <p><strong>Audit trails:</strong> In regulated industries (finance, healthcare, pharma), you need to prove who wrote what code and why. "The AI did it" isn't going to satisfy auditors. We need commit signing, approval workflows, and clear human accountability even when AI generates the implementation.</p>

            <p><strong>Training data risks:</strong> Every time you use an LLM on proprietary code, you're potentially leaking information—either to the provider or into future training data. This conflicts directly with NDA requirements and trade secret protections.</p>

            <p>
                The frameworks we rely on (NIST 800-53, ISO 27001, SOC 2) were written for a world where humans write code and humans review code. That mental model is breaking.
            </p>

            <h3>What This Means for 2026</h3>
            <p>
                Karpathy describes LLMs as "simultaneously a lot smarter than I expected and a lot dumber than I expected." That jagged capability profile is the challenge. An LLM can architect a microservice but fail at basic string manipulation. It can generate secure cryptographic code but accidentally log sensitive data.
            </p>
            <p>
                For those of us in compliance and security roles, 2026 needs to be the year we build the governance layer. That means:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>AI-aware security policies</strong> that define acceptable use of coding assistants</li>
                <li><strong>Automated guardrails</strong> in CI/CD pipelines that detect AI-generated vulnerabilities</li>
                <li><strong>Training programs</strong> so developers understand the risks, not just the productivity gains</li>
                <li><strong>Vendor assessments</strong> that evaluate how LLM providers handle proprietary code</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                The developer productivity gains are real and irreversible. Engineers using Claude, Cursor, or GitHub Copilot are measurably faster. But speed without safety isn't progress—it's technical debt at scale.
            </p>

            <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
            <p>
                Karpathy ends his review noting that we haven't realized "anywhere near 10% of [LLMs'] potential even at present capability." I agree, but with a caveat: unlocking that potential requires more than better models. It requires better integration into professional workflows, clearer mental models of what these tools can and can't do, and frankly, better compliance frameworks.
            </p>
            <p>
                2025 was the year AI coding assistants became mainstream. 2026 needs to be the year we make them secure, auditable, and trustworthy at enterprise scale.
