I had this amazing opportunity with my company to stay in France for 4 months end of 2018. The year in general has been rough, But this opportunity at the year end gave me a great chance to travel around Italy as I was staying in south of France bordering Italy and it was in an hours reach. You hop in to TER sleep for a hour and before you realize you are in Italy travelling along the beautiful Cote’d’Azur. I had the opportunity to visit Milan, Florence, Piacenza, Rome and Pisa. It wouldn’t make justice me describing the landscape in words since I am no author, I will leave it for you to Google it.

Florence had an amazing food scene. To me the most important was to try out a good pizza and gelato and yes i did find the right spot. If you are the person who doesn’t like random stuff thrown in your pizza and you prefer it simple and classic Gusta’s Pizza is your place. Located across River Arno just opposite Piazza Pitti where you can wander around the beautiful street paintings is a small shop selling just few varieties (If my memory serves right, Around 7) types of pizza. I had the Gusta’s pizza and justice was right served at my table.

Once you finish relishing the pizza your ordered, Take a small stroll around River Arno to let your pizza settle. Give room for the cheese to melt it and absorb and become part of you while you enjoy the beautiful view of the roof Palazzo Vecchio from other side of the river. Just a block ahead is the spot you need to go in to get your amazing Gelato experience. Walk in to Gelateria La Carria and not anything else around the block (They are all really expensive) except La Carria. Wait for the hostess to greet you and play around the flavours to create your desired Gelato.

To me food in Italy is the best I have had around in my experience so far travelling. I wont take India in to consideration as those are completely different types of food. A general rule of thumb, never wander in to any place that is touristy just walk the extra mile to find the hidden gem and you wouldn’t be disappointed. This was how i discovered an amazing pub by the name Angies Pub (BTW Angie is a guy). The ambience was cozy and the people were extremely friendly and the mood was lit. Have a sip of Italian beer and smile your way down the streets
