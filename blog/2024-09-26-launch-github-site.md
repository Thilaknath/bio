After thinking about launching my personal website for quite some time, I’m excited to finally make it a reality! I had tried tools like Wix in the past, but they never quite stuck. Enter Docusaurus—a game changer. The simplicity of its bootstrap template and how easy it is to learn made the process not just straightforward but fun. Building this site has been a rewarding experience, and it feels great to have a platform where I can share more about who I am and what I do.

This site will be a blend of everything that interests me. From my work in tech, to my adventures in travel, to my love of good food, I’ll be regularly updating the blog section with posts on all these topics. So, whether you’re here to learn more about my professional journey or to see what I’ve been up to outside of work, there will be something for everyone.

I’m looking forward to sharing my thoughts and experiences with you. Stay tuned for more updates!
