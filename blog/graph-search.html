            <p>
                So have you all been wondering whats this new play from Facebook is all about, even I too have the same anxiety to know what it is all about? First of all why graph search? When we have the giant Google and many other toddlers out there. Lets get in to what made Facebook launch an extensive social search engine and how does it function with our privacy in its hand.
            </p>

            <h3>What is Graph Search?</h3>
            <p>
                It's always nice to share music and to know interests of people in our social circle with whom we can share our opinion in our area of interest, also this gives a great opportunity for an individual to widen his networking and social skills. Yes this is what graph search is all about. For instance it lets you corner down friends who liked Transformers and live in Montreal or if you are a foodie, it will help you corner down your besties who loves munching poutine at La Bansique or who loves eating at thattu kadai in Chennai. It creates a better platform for you to stay connected than to just chat and exchange conversations.
            </p>

            <h3>Why Facebook Entered Search</h3>
            <p>
                So why has Facebook really forayed in to search engine. I pretty much feel this might be a great move from Facebook post their rocky IPO offering, but this hasn't managed to increase the stock price of Facebook as it still continue to remain low since it was offered.
            </p>

            <h3>Privacy Implications</h3>
            <p>
                Now arises a great question for those who feel privacy is something that needs to be watched and taken care of, obviously if you don't want your girl friend to find that you have hanged out with a different while still you are in a relationship. It's time my friend you start un-tagging all those pictures of you before you get caught red handed. Time and again Facebook has played the spoil spot for lover boys and this one is one such great tool for all the girls out there.
            </p>

            <h3>The Future of Social Search</h3>
            <p>
                This might surely not be what Google search is capable of or what it does, but is surely a great platform in the social search engine scenario which could grow in to something more dependable in future. Imagine searching Google for a restaurant and reading its reviews on Yelp or any other site for that matter would not be that handy when compared to your own friends review on that restaurant, which you feel is going to be more reliable, that is graph search all about.
