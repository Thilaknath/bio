            <p>
                Google Labs just released something that's going to change how small businesses and creators approach product photography: <strong>Pomelli Photoshoot</strong>. Powered by Nano Banana (Google's latest image generation model) and backed by the intelligence of Gemini 3.1 Pro, this tool transforms a single product photo into professional marketing assets in seconds.

            <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #4285f4; padding-left: 1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; font-style: italic;">
                Pomelli Photoshoot democratizes professional product photography, what used to require a studio, photographer, and hours of post-production can now be achieved with a phone camera and an AI tool.
            </blockquote>

            <h3>What is Pomelli Photoshoot?</h3>
            <p>
                <a href="https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/models-and-research/google-labs/pomelli-photoshoot/">Pomelli</a> is Google's AI-powered marketing assistant from Google Labs. The new Photoshoot feature allows users to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Generate professional product portfolios from a single reference image</li>
                <li>Create multiple angles and compositions automatically</li>
                <li>Produce campaign-ready banners with text overlays</li>
                <li>Apply consistent, studio-quality lighting and styling</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The magic happens through <strong>Nano Banana</strong>, Google's improved image generation model that offers higher accuracy, better prompt adherence, and sophisticated editing capabilities like background changes and style references.
            </p>

            <h3>My Experiment: Hand Cream Goes to the Studio</h3>
            <p>
                I decided to test Pomelli with something mundane sitting on my desk—a tube of Crabtree & Evelyn hand cream. Here's what I started with:
            </p>

            <h4>The Original Photo</h4>
            <figure style="margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                <img src="../static/img/actual-photo.jpg" alt="Original photo - casual desk shot of hand cream" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
                <figcaption style="color: #666; font-size: 0.9rem; margin-top: 0.5rem; font-style: italic;">My actual photo: a quick snap on a wooden desk with harsh lighting and no staging</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                This is exactly the kind of photo most of us have—taken with a phone, uneven lighting, cluttered background. Not something you'd put on a product page or marketing material.
            </p>

            <h4>The Pomelli Transformations</h4>
            <p>Here's what Pomelli generated from that single image:</p>

            <figure style="margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                <img src="../static/img/pomelli-image.png" alt="Pomelli generated - elegant lifestyle shot" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
                <figcaption style="color: #666; font-size: 0.9rem; margin-top: 0.5rem; font-style: italic;">Pomelli output: elegant marble surface, white flowers, ribbon—instant lifestyle branding</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure style="margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                <img src="../static/img/pomelli-image-1.png" alt="Pomelli generated - clean product shot" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
                <figcaption style="color: #666; font-size: 0.9rem; margin-top: 0.5rem; font-style: italic;">Pomelli output: clean white background, perfect for e-commerce listings</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure style="margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                <img src="../static/img/pomelli-image-2.png" alt="Pomelli generated - spa themed composition" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
                <figcaption style="color: #666; font-size: 0.9rem; margin-top: 0.5rem; font-style: italic;">Pomelli output: spa-themed composition with aloe, sea salt, and water droplets</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>The results are remarkable. From one mediocre phone photo, I got:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A lifestyle shot that could go on Instagram or a brand homepage</li>
                <li>A clean product shot suitable for any e-commerce platform</li>
                <li>A themed composition that tells a story about the product</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>The Technology Behind It</h3>
            <p>
                This release coincides with <a href="https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/models-and-research/gemini-models/gemini-3-1-pro/">Gemini 3.1 Pro</a>, Google's latest model that scored 77.1% on ARC AGI—above the average human baseline. Gemini 3.1 Pro brings enhanced multimodal reasoning, including the ability to analyze images through code execution (cropping, zooming, annotating) in a think-act-observe loop.
            </p>
            <p>
                While Pomelli uses Nano Banana for image generation specifically, the broader Gemini ecosystem powers the understanding of what makes a "good" product photo and how to compose scenes that feel professional.
            </p>

            <h3>My Take: Disruption for SMBs and Creators</h3>

            <h4>The Good</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Cost savings are massive.</strong> A professional product photoshoot can cost anywhere from $500 to $5,000+ depending on the product and scope. Pomelli is free (currently rolling out in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Speed is unmatched.</strong> What took days of planning, shooting, and editing now takes seconds. For businesses with large product catalogs, this is transformative.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Consistency at scale.</strong> When you're selling 100 products, maintaining visual consistency across all of them is expensive. AI handles this trivially.
            </p>

            <h4>The Concerns</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Authenticity questions.</strong> As these tools become ubiquitous, will consumers start distrusting all product photography? The "what you see is what you get" promise of photography is eroding.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Copyright gray areas.</strong> The AI is generating props, backgrounds, and styling elements. What happens when it inadvertently recreates someone else's copyrighted setup or style?
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Professional disruption.</strong> Product photographers, stylists, and studios will feel this directly. The entry-level work that sustained many photographers is being automated away.
            </p>

            <h4>The Compliance Angle</h4>
            <p>
                For those of us in regulated industries, there's a governance question here too. Marketing claims need to be truthful. If your AI-generated "lifestyle shot" shows the product in a context that implies capabilities it doesn't have, you're in murky waters.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, many jurisdictions are moving toward disclosure requirements for AI-generated content. Businesses using Pomelli for marketing should be preparing for this regulatory environment.
            </p>

            <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
            <p>
                Pomelli Photoshoot represents a genuine leap in AI capabilities for practical business use. It's not a research demo or a "coming soon" announcement, it's a working tool that produces genuinely useful output today.
            </p>
            <p>
                For small businesses and individual creators, this removes a significant barrier to professional presentation. For existing photography professionals, it's a signal to move up the value chain toward work that requires genuine human creativity, not just technical execution.
            </p>
            <p>
                As with most AI tools, the question isn't whether to use them, but how to use them responsibly. The technology is here. The governance frameworks are still catching up.
            </p>
