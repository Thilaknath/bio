While these efforts are critical, they\'re typically manual and time-consuming. Tasks like risk classification, threat modeling, code reviews, and security assessments depend on human expertise and are subject to individual variability.\\n\\n:::info\\nAs organizations scale, it becomes impractical to expect AppSec teams to manually assess every component, and this is where AI offers a solution.\\n:::\\n\\n## The Opportunity with Generative AI and LLMs\\n\\nLLMs like OpenAI\'s models are reshaping the way we approach software development, providing capabilities to automate repetitive, labor-intensive tasks. By understanding and generating human-like text, these models can simplify complex security tasks, making AppSec more efficient.\\n\\n> Imagine a scenario where LLMs could automate routine security reviews and handle tasks that were previously too minor to warrant manual oversight, thereby expanding the coverage of an AppSec team without additional personnel.\\n\\n### Introducing AI-based \\"Security Oracles\\"\\n\\nUsing frameworks like **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, organizations can implement AI-based \\"Security Oracles.\\" These AI agents can:\\n- Query best practices\\n- Access security policies\\n- Analyze organizational data\\n- Provide contextual security insights\\n\\nFor example, SecurityGPT could answer questions, generate tailored recommendations, and produce security documentation by leveraging an organization\'s existing resources.\\n\\n## High-Level Workflow: AI-Enhanced AppSec Activities\\n\\nHere\'s a breakdown of how AI agents could streamline a security review process, using the Security Review Process Funnel as a model:\\n\\n### 1. Risk Classification\\n- AI-powered risk scoring based on technical specifications\\n- Alignment with organization\'s framework\\n- Automation of lower-risk assessments\\n\\n### 2. Rapid Risk Assessment\\n- Integration with Mozilla\'s RRA guide\\n- Automated impact analysis\\n- Instant report generation\\n- Standardized evaluations\\n\\n### 3.

To me the most important was to try out a good pizza and gelato and yes i did find the right spot. If you are the person who doesn\u2019t like random stuff thrown in your pizza and you prefer it simple and classic Gusta\u2019s Pizza is your place. Located across River Arno just opposite Piazza Pitti where you can wander around the beautiful street paintings is a small shop selling just few varieties (If my memory serves right, Around 7) types of pizza. I had the Gusta\u2019s pizza and justice was right served at my table.\\n\\nOnce you finish relishing the pizza your ordered, Take a small stroll around River Arno to let your pizza settle. Give room for the cheese to melt it and absorb and become part of you while you enjoy the beautiful view of the roof Palazzo Vecchio from other side of the river. Just a block ahead is the spot you need to go in to get your amazing Gelato experience. Walk in to Gelateria La Carria and not anything else around the block (They are all really expensive) except La Carria. Wait for the hostess to greet you and play around the flavours to create your desired Gelato.\\n\\nTo me food in Italy is the best I have had around in my experience so far travelling. I wont take India in to consideration as those are completely different types of food. A general rule of thumb, never wander in to any place that is touristy just walk the extra mile to find the hidden gem and you wouldn\u2019t be disappointed. This was how i discovered an amazing pub by the name Angies Pub (BTW Angie is a guy). The ambience was cozy and the people were extremely friendly and the mood was lit.

They just bham you right in your life and cause panic and utter confusion around all the loved ones.\\n\\nThings unfolded very quickly when my dad had some pain in the stomach and was taken to a nearby doctor who loaded him with medicines and suggested if you get pain in the future visit me. It wasn\u2019t a satisfactory answer for my mom who wanted a cure for her husbands pain rather than a temporary relief. She furthered it with another consultation with one of the specialist in town and that day marked the turn down of events in my dads health. He was diagnosed with HCC and the doctor suggested to go ahead with TACE procedure. But later the next day after another round of scans he and a team of doctors suggested TACE is not possible and only TARE could be done at this moment and it should be noted that all these are palliative treatment options. He was prescribed to be on Sorafenib as that\u2019s the only other medication if the former was not performed. I was midway to my hometown to realize and understand what my family has been drawn in to and support them.\\n\\nWhat i witnessed at first sight was how health and medicine has turned in to a multi billion dollar industry in India. This was my first thought that ran in my mind when i visited the hospital to discharge my dad. Fortunately i had my family insured as the government does not provide any support to a common man. But my insurance was a minimal cover and it could hardly cover my dads expense. My sister was the strongest in the house in terms of getting things done. She fought our way to get my dad discharged before we could commit in to any treatments. Based on the reports there was no biopsy done to assert that it is cancer, what he had for sure was advanced cirrhosis. Either way both are terminal.\\n\\nThe following days we visited multiple doctors and talked with Radiologists, friends and relatives. Everyone turned sympathy towards us and suggested their own doctors on this line which made us to believe there is at least something that could be done to his condition. But reality had a different answer, opinions from multiple doctors were the same. Do radiation or either leave it at its state with the current medication. As a son i was confused as to what to decide Should I experiment him with medicines and treatments that can prolong his life with pain? We decided with a belief in God lets continue the current medication and change his eating habits and stop him from his work, which was more physical.\\n\\nEver since then, every day is a milestone for us. Making my dad stay home was difficult as he has never done it in his life. We are doing our best to provided him with proper nutrition. The following are something to note and rush to a medic to prevent a terminal liver disease. Out of all he is a diabetic and as we know it is a slow killer.\\n\\nWeight Loss (Gradually over the months)\\nWatch your sugar level in your body (If you are diabetic)\\nGradual loss of apetite\\nFelling of contentedness with less food.\\nWays to over come it and safeguard your liver. Watch your food intake\\n\\nReduced salt usage\\nNo fat food (Oil less food)\\nSplit your meals across the day.\\nKeep your mind healthy and positive and leave negative thoughts at bay.\\nMy dad always believed that a sound mind in a sound body and i too strongly believe the same in keeping his mind strong thereby  enriching his body to fight the terminal evil that is with in him."},{"id":"technology","metadata":{"permalink":"/bio/blog/technology","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2013-01-16-graph-search.md","source":"@site/blog/2013-01-16-graph-search.md","title":"Graph Search","description":"So have you all been wondering whats this new play from facebook is all about, even i too have the same anxiety to know what it is all about?,  first of all why graph search?, when we have the giant google and many other toddlers out there.

Lets get in to what made facebook launch a extensive social search engine and how does it function with our privacy in its hand.\\n\\nI don\u2019t have to explain what facebook is, if i do i would be the most dumbest blogger ever, right away getting in to the graph search. It\u2019s always nice to share music and to know interests of people in our social circle with whom we can share our opinion in our area of interest,also this gives a great opportunity for an individual to widen his networking and social skills. Yes this is what graph search is all about . For instance it lets you corner down friends who liked  Transformers and live in Montreal or if you are a foodie, it will help you corner down your besties who loves munching  poutine at La Bansique or who loves eating at thattu kadai in Chennai. It creates a better platform for you to stay connected than to just chat and exchange conversations.\\n\\n\\nSo why has facebook really forayed in to search engine. I pretty much feel this might be a great move from facebook post their rocky IPO offering, but this hasn\u2019t managed to increase the stock price of facebook as it still continue to remain low since it was offered.\\n\\nNow arises a great question for those who feel privacy is something that needs to be watched and taken care of, obviously if you don\u2019t want your girl friend to find that you have hanged out with a different while still you are in a relationship. It\u2019s time my friend you start un-tagging all those pictures of you before you get caught red handed ;). Time and again facebook has played the spoil spot for lover boys and this one is one such great tool for all the girls out there.\\n\\nThis might surely not be what google search is capable of or what it does, but is surely a great platform in the social search engine scenario which could grow in to something more dependable in future. Imagine searching google for a restaurant and reading its reviews on yelp or any other site for that matter would not be that handy when compared to your own friends review on that restaurant, which you feel is going to be more reliable, that is graph search all about.\\n\\nHope you enjoy it folks, sign up here to join the waiting list to be one of the first to experience the power of social search."},{"id":"society","metadata":{"permalink":"/bio/blog/society","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2013-01-05-society.md","source":"@site/blog/2013-01-05-society.md","title":"Where are we headed to?","description":"I know everyone out there in the cyber space associated towards India must be aware of the news of the Brutal rape of medical student in the national capital.

As far as i know there aren\u2019t much schemes which motivates kids being sent to school, Right to education is just a right and we can proudly say that we have a right which doesn\u2019t give anything out of it. Freebies! government gives TV,grinder, and most of the households for free, instead why cant they give free education and accessories which support the education for free to the desired aspirants who are out there in numerous number.\\n\\nThere are only very few model villages. one such worth mentioning is Punsari in gujarat. villages are the backbone of  India and real development starts only from here. I would say the governance at its poorest form in India, good governance and development automatically blossoms when respect is mutual for all the gender. There are  incidents which leaves our minds in a state of fizzy and this is one incident which had grasped the attention of all the parts of the society. it was a poor show by the administration of the hospital to shift her to Singapore for treatment.

This was eventually set in our mind when we started working on the project for recovering cryptography keys and we had particularly targeted only Truecrypt as we didn\u2019t have much time to work on.\\n\\nThe use of strong encryption into operating systems has created a challenge for forensic examiners potentially preventing from recovering any digital evidence from a whole disk encrypted system. Because strong encryption cannot be circumvented without a key or passphrase, forensic\\nexaminers may not be able to access data after a computer is shut down . Whole disk encryption software such as PGP and TrueCrypt enable file-level encryption, as well as disk-level encryption that may be mounted as a volume and used to store data . TrueCrypt encrypts the whole disk using a\\nselected encryption algorithm and hash algorithm, thus generating master key and secondary key which is based on multiple criteria .\\n\\nThe software needs to store the key in RAM, so a dump of the RAM can reveal the key. Dumping the RAM on a running system from another computer, without altering the integrity of the disk can be performed through FireWire (also known as IEEE1394 Bus). Another technique, called cold boot attack , suggests to physically shutdown and cool the DRAM chips and insert them in another computer, which can cause memory integrity errors and hence the need to perform additional recovery operations on the key. Here, the dump of the RAM is errorless.\\n\\nOur project was phased in to three important part of development of which are given below as follows\\n\\n1) Dump the RAM using Inception through FireWire\\nInception is an open source tool written in Python, made to exploit FireWire connection to get access to the RAM. It tries to establish a Direct Memory Access connection to further initiate a dump of the memory and write it to a local file.\\n\\n2) Develop a key extraction software for TrueCrypt 7\\n\\nAES encryption is a cipher based on Substitution-Permutation (SP)-network that works with 128, 198 or 256 bit keys. TrueCrypt uses the 256 bits version for an encryption using AES. Because this cipher is widely in use, fast in both software and hardware and is regarded as the de-facto standard\\nin most new cryptographic applications, we will focus on it in this project.\\n\\n3) Prepare an automated procedure to show the success of the attack on a running system"}]}}')}}]);
