            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Originally from Chennai, India, I completed my Bachelor's in Electronics and Communication,
                where I developed a deep interest in robotics and technology. During my undergraduate years,
                I actively engaged with the Robotics Interest Group, participating in prestigious Tech Fests
                at institutions such as IIT Kanpur, Anna University, and NIT Trichy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Motivated to deepen my understanding of technology's evolving landscape, I pursued a Master's
                degree in Information System Security in Montreal, Canada. This journey allowed me to merge
                my passion for security with the latest advancements in technology, preparing me for the
                dynamic challenges in the field of cybersecurity and beyond.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently working as a Compliance Engineering Expert, I guide teams toward seamless
                regulatory success with DevOps ingenuity, bringing over 10 years of experience in IT and
                security domains, specializing in Governance, Risk, and Compliance frameworks.
