                Originally from Chennai, India, I completed my Bachelor's in Electronics and Communication,
                where I developed a deep interest in robotics and technology. During my undergraduate years,
                I actively engaged with the Robotics Interest Group, participating in prestigious Tech Fests
                at institutions such as IIT Kanpur, Anna University, and NIT Trichy. I was fortunate enough
                to secure top positions in several of these competitions, honing my technical and
                problem-solving skills.

                my passion for security with the latest advancements in technology, preparing me for the
